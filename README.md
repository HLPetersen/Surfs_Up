# <b> Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis </b>

## <u>Overview of Analysis</u>
This analysis takes weather measurement data from 9 stations on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The comparison is on the temperature variations between the month of June and the month of December for the years 2010 to 2016. There are 1,200 observations for June and 1,517 observations for December.

### Purpose of Analysis

- The temperature range in June is 21 degrees while the range is 27 degrees for December. 
- The median temperatures are only 4 degrees different between the two months.
- Temperatures were measured 10% less in December than in June.

## <u>Summary</u>
The weather in Oahu stays fairly consistent over the year. The standard deviation for both months was close as were the mean and median of temperatures. It seems the weather would not be a big factor in the success or failure of the surf and ice cream shop. It would be enlightening to know what the weather was on the indicated days besides just the temperatures. It would also help to know the average range of temperatures for each year to see if it stays consistent year-toyear or if an extreme June or December is influencing those numbers.
